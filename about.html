              Hello, my name is Patrick Gerspach and welcome to my portfolio
              site! I am an aspiring web developer/software engineer who has
              completely changed the course of his life in pursuit of a more
              fulfilling and enjoyable career.
            </p>
            <p class="par">
              I began coding at the University of Notre Dame, where I studied
              mechanical engineering. My experience started with learning the
              basics of an archaic programming language called Fortran. From
              there, pieces of coding began to slip into my coursework through
              MatLAB and C, and it didn't take me long to desire to learn more.
            </p>

            <p class="par">
              Upon finishing my degree and starting work, I almost immediately
              signed up for the Columbia University Engineering Coding Boot
              Camp, which I am set to graduate in March. I have learned an
              incredible amount in such a short time, and my interest has only
              grown since the onset of my journey. I hope you enjoy browsing my
              projects as much as I enjoyed working on them!
